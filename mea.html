<h1 id="mainheading"> Early 2000's anime </h1>
    
<p id="heading"> During the early 2000's was when anime popped off in many countries outside of Japan, examples being America, England, Africa and other countries around the world. This was because it's when more and more anime shows were being created and creating fan bases and gaining more and more audiences with the new ways they animated the shows. It's stated that anime in the early 2000's were known to be more realistic and attractive as studios did their best with the animations due to digital editing not being a thing in those early days. Some names of the anime that came out in the early 2000's are Dragon Ball, Bleach, Inuyasha, Naruto, Avatar the last airbender, YuGiOh, Death Note, Full Metal Alchemist and many more. As it gained popularity, American companies bought rights to some anime tv shows to air on their channels such as Jetix, Cartoon Network and FOX Kids TV which was good for anime as a whole because it gained many audiences worldwide, and to thise day some of the shows from the early 2000's are still continued such as Pokemon, Bleach and Dragon Ball.
