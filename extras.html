            <h1>Spin off shows</h1>
              <p class="extras-p">Anime spin offs are one of the most notorious things to come out of anime series' becuase of it's popularity, and this gives creators and writers a chance to write a "what if" alternative to events taken place in the main story, or go down a route of following a different characters background story and/ or an event. An example is the main character in Naruto Shippuden is Naruto Uzumaki, but in the Naruto SD: Rock Lee & His Ninja Pals (the image above is a shot from the show with Rock Lee on the left and Naruto on the right).</p>

             <h1>Movies</h1>
              <p class="extras-p">Along with anime spin off shows, anime even get their own movies associated with the main story of the show, or even a spin off "what if" story. A prime example of this is the Dragon Ball Z series, because their movies are based on "what if" scenarios if the main antagonist in the show wasn't defeated, or got revived. Sometimes the anime might even be popular and get animated into live action movies which could be a hit or flop amongst fans and movie crities, and somehow Dragonball Z had an american based live action movie made called Dragonball Evolution.</p>

            <h1>Games</h1>
             <p class="extras-p">As anime has grown more and more on fans, game developers such as Bandai Namco, CC2, Sega and many others have taken well known anime franchises and made them a game series such as the Dragonball Xenoverse series, Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm series, One Piece Pirate Warriors series and even included a group of anime into one game such as the most recent one to date called Jump Force. Jump Force groups together protagonists from different shows where players can play as them against each other and play as them in a "what if" scenario against a set of game only antagonists.

          <h1>References in other shows</h1>
          <p class="extras-p">Anime are referenced through many industries such as movies with the show name or character being referenced, other anime shows referencing other anime. However the most common shows that have anime references are cartoon shows such as The Amazing World of Gumball having a reference to Dragon Ball Z, Rick and Morty referencing an anime called Akira by having one of the main characters go through an episode from the anime. Even the most known cartoon show The Simpsons has referenced many anime shows such as Astro Boy, Naruto, Spirited Away, Attack on Titan, Inuyasha and Pokemon in just one episode.</p>
